# PythonScripts
Couple of scripts I play around with, they'll become more useful

Porty.py is a simple IPv4 port scanner, its features are only going to be expanded through PortFunction.py

PortFunction.py is (currently) functionally the same as Porty.py, though I've added functions to later be used for IPv6 and name resolution functionality.
